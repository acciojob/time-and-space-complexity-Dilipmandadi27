<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>
     <p>The <b>Space complexity</b> of an algorithm or a data structure is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.[1] This includes the memory space used by its inputs, called input space, and any other (auxiliary) memory it uses during execution, which is called auxiliary space.</p>
